			<p>lazyBum is the new node.js framework created by <a href="http://streetsaheadllc.com">Streets Ahead LLC</a>.  We built lazyBum because we wanted to be able to build applications the way we wanted to build applications.  We know that every developer has their own ideas about how things should be done and this is ours.  Currently lazyBum is in a very alpha stage.  It can probably be thought more like a proof of concept than a production ready framework.  That said we believe in the development model of our little framework and we hope you check it out.  We welcome contributions so feel free to fork away.  This is primarily a weekend/evening project for us so we give it as much attention as we can but things may not always move quickly, that said feel free to provide feedback and report bugs.</p>

			<h4>To use lazyBum type </h4>

			<pre>&gt; npm install -g lazyBum</pre>

			<p><em>Note: You are not required to use the -g option, but it may make it easier.  The -g flag installs globally, installing it this way will make sure you can always access you command line utility.</em> </p>

			<p>Once you have installed lazyBum you can get started by using our command line utility to generate a project.  Create a new directory and move into it, then use the init command shown below.</p>

			<pre>&gt; lazybum init</pre>

			<p>This will generate the basic folder structure for an lb project.  If you have used Rails, Grails, CodeIgniter, etc this should look relatively familiar.  The first folders you'll want to take note of are Controllers and Templates.  As implied the controllers folder will contain all your controllers and the template folder will contain your templates.  We use a custom template engine that is basically an adapted version of <a href="https://github.com/ollym/parrot">Parrot</a>.  You can test your new project by typing <code>node main.js</code> then visit <code><a href='http://localhost:8888/' target='_blank'>http://localhost:8888</a></code> in your browser.</p>

		<section id='collections'>
			<h2>Collections</h2>
			<p>Collections in lazyBum map directly to MongoDB collections.  You can create a collection with the </p>

			<pre>&gt; lazybum create collection &lt;CollectionName&gt;</pre>
		</section>
		<section id='controllers'>
			<h2>Controllers</h2>
			<p>Controllers are where the main logic of your application will live.  You can create a collection with the </p>

			<pre>&gt; lazybum create controller &lt;ControllerName&gt;</pre>
		</section>
		<section id='file_server'>
			<h2>File Server</h2>
			<p>lazyBum has a very basic built in file server.  lB will check the <code>public</code> folder if a file exists before passing you along to a controller.  The file server will set cacheing headers on your content, and will correclty return 304 not modified when your content hasn't changed.  There is also a very basic file cache which attempts to store the most recently accessed files in memory so that it can limit disk accesses.  While the lb file server works well in basic situations and makes developing applications quicker and easier, when deploying your app to production you may want to consider using a CDN or at the very least Apache or Nginex to host your static content.  This will take some of the burden off of your Node instance and leave file serving to the pros.</p>

		<section id='helpers'>
			<h2>Helpers</h2>

			<p>Helpers are basically collections of functions that  "help" with specific tasks.  Helpers do not need to be written using any special convention, they are simply node.js modules that are placed inside of the "helpers" directory.  Helpers can be added to a controller, once added they can be accessed using the "this" variable.  Any helper that is included in a controller will also be available in the template.</p>

			<p>An example of how to register the html helper in a controller.</p>

			<pre>this.prototype.helpers = ['html'];</pre>
		</section>
		<section id='hooks'>
			<h2>Hooks</h2>
			<p>Currenlty hooks are offer a very basic way to intercept users request to do pre or post processing.  In the future lB may add more hook points but currenlty it is limited to pre-controller or post-controller.  A common use case for hooks is to add a pre-controller hook for authentication.</p>
		</section>
		<section id='renderers'>
			<h2>Renderers</h2>
			<p>Renderers provide the mechanism for your content to be rendered in different formats based on the extension.  In lazyBum core there are renderers for json, html, and xml.  You can override any of these by creating a file with th esame name in the Renderers directory.  For instance if you want to use an alternate template engine you could override the html renderer.  If you look at Vagabond you can find an example of an RSS renderer using our feedBum module.</p>
